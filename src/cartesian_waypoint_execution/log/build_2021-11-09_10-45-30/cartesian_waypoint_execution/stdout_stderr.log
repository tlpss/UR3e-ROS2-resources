CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrviz_visual_tools.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rviz_visual_tools", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rviz_visual_tools"
  with any of the following names:

    rviz_visual_toolsConfig.cmake
    rviz_visual_tools-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rviz_visual_tools" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "rviz_visual_tools_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "rviz_visual_tools" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
