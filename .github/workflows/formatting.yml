# This is a format job. Pre-commit has a first-party GitHub action, so we use
# that: https://github.com/pre-commit/action

## note that using pre-commit CI would be faster but there is no hook for clang-format-10 and this specific version is used by Moveit,
# newer onese are not backwards compatible
